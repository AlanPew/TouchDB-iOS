{"name":"TouchDB","google":"","body":"# TouchDB #\r\n\r\nby Jens Alfke (jens@couchbase.com)  \r\nwith contributions from Alexander Edge, Chris Kau, J Chris Anderson, Marty Schoch, Paul Mietz Egli  \r\nand technical advice from Damien Katz and Filipe Manana\r\n\r\n**TouchDB** is a lightweight [Apache CouchDB][1]-compatible database engine suitable for embedding into mobile or desktop apps. Think of it this way: If CouchDB is MySQL, then TouchDB is SQLite.\r\n\r\nBy \"_CouchDB-compatible_\" I mean that it can replicate with CouchDB, and that its data model and high-level design are \"Couch-like\" enough to make it familiar to CouchDB/Couchbase developers. Its REST API is nearly identical, though it doesn't support a few CouchDB features, like user accounts, that aren't useful in mobile apps. Its implementation is _not_ based on CouchDB's (it's not even written in Erlang.) It _does_ support replication to and from CouchDB.\r\n\r\nBy \"_suitable for embedding into mobile apps_\", I mean that it meets the following requirements:\r\n\r\n * Small code size; currently about 250kbytes. (Code size is important to mobile apps, which are often downloaded over cell networks.)\r\n * Quick startup time on relatively-slow CPUs; ideally 100ms or less.\r\n * Low memory usage with typical mobile data-sets. The expectation is the number of documents will not be huge, although there may be sizable multimedia attachments.\r\n * \"Good enough\" performance with these CPUs and data-sets.\r\n\r\nAnd by \"_mobile apps_\" I'm focusing on iOS and [Android][11], although there's no reason we couldn't extend this to other platforms like Windows Phone. And it's not limited to mobile OSs -- the Objective-C implementation runs on Mac OS as well, and on Linux and other Unix-like OSs via [GNUstep][12].\r\n\r\nMore documentation is available on the [wiki][2].\r\n\r\n## Platforms ##\r\n\r\n * **Mac OS X** -- 10.7.2 or higher.\r\n * **iOS** -- 5.0 or higher.\r\n * **Linux, BSD, etc** -- Any platform [supported by][13] current [GNUstep][12] and libobjc2.\r\n * **MS Windows** -- As [supported by][13] GNUstep using MingW.\r\n * **Android / Java** -- Has its own source base and [repository][11].\r\n\r\n## Requirements ##\r\n\r\n * It's written in Objective-C.\r\n * Xcode 4.3+ is required to build it (Clang 3.0+, with GNUstep).\r\n * Runtime system requirements for Apple platforms are iOS 5+, or Mac OS X 10.7.2+.\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\n\r\n * TouchDB itself is under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n * [FMDB][5], by [Gus Mueller][8], is under the MIT License.\r\n * [Google Toolbox For Mac][10] is under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n * [CocoaHTTPServer][9], by Robbie Hanson, is under the BSD License.\r\n * [MYUtilities][6] (portions of which are copied into the vendor/MYUtilities directory) is under the BSD License. (But note that I, Jens, wrote MYUtilities and would have no problem re-licensing it under Apache for use here.)\r\n\r\n## Development Status ##\r\n\r\nTouchDB went beta in June 2012 with [version 0.8][16].\r\n\r\nWe don't have a formal schedule for 1.0, but expect the blessed event by the end of summer.\r\n\r\n## Building TouchDB ##\r\n\r\n### On a Mac ###\r\n\r\nFor full details see the [wiki page][7]. The basic steps are:\r\n\r\n 1. Clone the TouchDB repository to your local disk.\r\n 2. In that directory run \"`git submodule init`\" and then \"`git submodule update`\". This will clone the dependent library repos (such as [FMDB][5] and [MYUtilities][6]) into the vendor/ subdirectory.\r\n 3. Open the Xcode project and build the \"Mac Framework\" and/or \"iOS Framework\" schemes.\r\n\r\n### With GNUstep ###\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the files [BUILDING.txt][14] and [SETUP.txt][15] in the `GNUstep` directory.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://couchdb.apache.org\r\n[2]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/wiki\r\n[3]: http://couchbase.com\r\n[4]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/CouchCocoa\r\n[5]: https://github.com/touchbaselabs/fmdb\r\n[6]: https://bitbucket.org/snej/myutilities/overview\r\n[7]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/wiki/Building-TouchDB\r\n[8]: https://github.com/ccgus/\r\n[9]: https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaHTTPServer\r\n[10]: http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/\r\n[11]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-Android\r\n[12]: http://www.gnustep.org/\r\n[13]: http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/Platform_compatibility\r\n[14]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/blob/master/GNUstep/BUILDING.txt\r\n[15]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/blob/master/GNUstep/SETUP.txt\r\n[16]: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/TouchDB-iOS/commit/ee47a8ab49fee46df377f35717c129c4abc894d0","note":"Don't delete this file!
